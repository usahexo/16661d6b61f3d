        <h1 id="Billionaire-buys-San-Manuel-internet-casino"><a href="#Billionaire-buys-San-Manuel-internet-casino" class="headerlink" title="Billionaire buys San Manuel internet casino"></a>Billionaire buys San Manuel internet casino</h1><p>A mogul from the Silicon Valley has just bought the San Manuel internet casino. The new owner is a billionaire who made his fortune in the technology industry. He is said to be a major player in the online poker world.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, which owns and operates the casino, announced the sale on Monday. Terms of the deal were not released, but it’s believed that the billionaire paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $360 million for it.</p>
<p>This comes as a bit of a surprise because the casino has been up for sale since early last year. It was initially put on the market for $500 million, but no buyers could be found. The billionaire may have been able to get it for a discount because of its struggles in recent years.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino opened in 1986 and was one of the first tribal casinos in California. It quickly became one of the most popular gambling destinations in Southern California. In its heyday, it was generating more than $1 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p>However, things have taken a turn for the worse in recent years. Competition from other tribal casinos and non-tribal casinos has taken its toll. Revenue has declined significantly, and the casino is now losing money.</p>
<p>The new owner plans to invest heavily in the casino and turn it around. He says he is committed to making it “the best gaming experience possible”. He also vows to create jobs and contribute to the local economy.</p>
<p>Many people are skeptical about whether he can turn things around, but only time will tell. In any case, it will be interesting to see what happens at San Manuel under new ownership.</p>

Reportedly, 47-year-old Zhang Zhao agreed to pay $280 million for the gambling complex. </p>
<p>Zhao is the founder and chairman of Beijing-based LeYOU Technologies Holdings Ltd., a company that operates online games and mobile content. The purchase of San Manuel Casino will give him a foothold in the United States gambling market. </p>
<p>The transaction still requires regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>
<h1 id="San-Manuel-internet-casino-sold-to-mystery-buyer"><a href="#San-Manuel-internet-casino-sold-to-mystery-buyer" class="headerlink" title="San Manuel internet casino sold to mystery buyer"></a>San Manuel internet casino sold to mystery buyer</h1><p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has announced that it has sold its casino and resort to an undisclosed buyer.</p>
<p>According to tribal chairman Richard Milanovich, the proceeds from the sale will be used to invest in new economic development opportunities for the tribe. The identity of the new owner is shrouded in secrecy, with only rumors circulating as to who may have bought the property.</p>
<p>The casino resort is a popular destination for visitors in Southern California, and employs over 2,000 people. It includes a 278-room hotel, a convention center, and various restaurants and gaming facilities.</p>
<p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has been one of the most successful tribes in California in terms of economic development. In addition to the casino resort, they operate a manufacturing plant, a trucking company, and several other businesses. They are also one of the largest landowners in Southern California.</p>
<p>The sale comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as San Manuel had been one of the last major casinos in California not owned by one of the big Las Vegas gaming companies.</p>
<h1 id="Who-bought-San-Manuel-internet-casino"><a href="#Who-bought-San-Manuel-internet-casino" class="headerlink" title="Who bought San Manuel internet casino?"></a>Who bought San Manuel internet casino?</h1><p>The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians bought the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino in Highland, California from the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians.</p>
<p>The Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians is a federally recognized tribe of Native Americans with a reservation located in Tehama County, California. The tribe owns and operates the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino in Highland, California which it purchased from the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians in 1998.</p>

The casino, which is one of the largest in the country, will now be owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corp., the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and two Native American tribes.</p>
<p>The sale was first announced back in February and has now closed after receiving the necessary approvals. The new owners have said that they plan to invest in the property and improve its offerings. They also plan to work with the tribe that currently operates the casino to make sure that their interests are protected.</p>
<p>The San Manuel casino has been in operation since 1986 and is one of the most popular gaming destinations in the country. It features 2,000 slot machines, 83 table games and a number of dining and entertainment options.</p>
<p>The deal is thought to be one of the largestever for an Indian gaming property in the United States. It is also expected to help create hundreds of jobs both at the casino itself and its suppliers.</p>
