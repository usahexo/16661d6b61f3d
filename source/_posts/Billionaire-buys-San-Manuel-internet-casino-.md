#  Billionaire buys San Manuel internet casino 

A mogul from the Silicon Valley has just bought the San Manuel internet casino. The new owner is a billionaire who made his fortune in the technology industry. He is said to be a major player in the online poker world.

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, which owns and operates the casino, announced the sale on Monday. Terms of the deal were not released, but it's believed that the billionaire paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $360 million for it.

This comes as a bit of a surprise because the casino has been up for sale since early last year. It was initially put on the market for $500 million, but no buyers could be found. The billionaire may have been able to get it for a discount because of its struggles in recent years.

The San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino opened in 1986 and was one of the first tribal casinos in California. It quickly became one of the most popular gambling destinations in Southern California. In its heyday, it was generating more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

However, things have taken a turn for the worse in recent years. Competition from other tribal casinos and non-tribal casinos has taken its toll. Revenue has declined significantly, and the casino is now losing money.

The new owner plans to invest heavily in the casino and turn it around. He says he is committed to making it "the best gaming experience possible". He also vows to create jobs and contribute to the local economy.

Many people are skeptical about whether he can turn things around, but only time will tell. In any case, it will be interesting to see what happens at San Manuel under new ownership.

One of the richest men in China has just purchased the San Manuel Indian band’s casino in Southern California. Reportedly, 47-year-old Zhang Zhao agreed to pay $280 million for the gambling complex. 

Zhao is the founder and chairman of Beijing-based LeYOU Technologies Holdings Ltd., a company that operates online games and mobile content. The purchase of San Manuel Casino will give him a foothold in the United States gambling market. 

The transaction still requires regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of the year.

#  San Manuel internet casino sold to mystery buyer 

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has announced that it has sold its casino and resort to an undisclosed buyer.

According to tribal chairman Richard Milanovich, the proceeds from the sale will be used to invest in new economic development opportunities for the tribe. The identity of the new owner is shrouded in secrecy, with only rumors circulating as to who may have bought the property.

The casino resort is a popular destination for visitors in Southern California, and employs over 2,000 people. It includes a 278-room hotel, a convention center, and various restaurants and gaming facilities.

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has been one of the most successful tribes in California in terms of economic development. In addition to the casino resort, they operate a manufacturing plant, a trucking company, and several other businesses. They are also one of the largest landowners in Southern California.

The sale comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as San Manuel had been one of the last major casinos in California not owned by one of the big Las Vegas gaming companies.
